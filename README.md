# interview

## Goal of this repository

Collection of notes and interview guidelines at hibooks
 - Example interview questions and review of how to grade the task
 - Reminder of things that should be brought up during the interview

## Blogging

We want to use an engineering blog as a tool to attract engineers and create brand recognition amongst the engineering community
We want to blog about any slightly interesting engineering topics or problems that we had to solve. Hyper specificity is good! 

## Phone screen/interview guidelines

- Be ready and available 5 minutes before the interview starts (DON'T BE LATE!)
- Interviews should be around 1hr:
    - 5 - 10 minute personal intro + info about company
    - 10 - 20 minute question about projects and previous work
        - Deep dive into specific problems they have worked on in the past
        - Assess for clarity and how well they communicate and explain ideas
        - Ask about technologies they used and specific choices they had made
    - 25 - 35 Coderpad interview question
        - Remember to ask them to articulate their thought processes
    - 10 minutes interviewee to ask questions 
        - The interview is as much as an assessment of them as it is an assessment of us.
